# pt: a golang path tracer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fogleman/pt.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fogleman/pt) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/fogleman/pt/pt?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/fogleman/pt/pt)

This is a CPU-only, unidirectional [path tracing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing) engine written in Go. The Go gopher below was rendered using it, and [here's the code](https://github.com/fogleman/pt/blob/master/examples/gopher.go) that was used to do it. The gopher 3D model was found [here](https://github.com/golang-samples/gopher-3d).

### Installation

    go get -u github.com/fogleman/pt/pt

### Examples

The are [lots of examples](https://github.com/fogleman/pt/tree/master/examples) to learn from! To try them, just run, e.g.

    cd go/src/github.com/fogleman/pt
    go run examples/gopher.go

### Features

* Supports OBJ and STL
* Supports textures, bump maps and normal maps
* Supports volume rendering from image slices
* Supports various material properties
* Supports configurable depth of field
* Supports iterative rendering
* Uses k-d trees to accelerate ray intersection tests
* Uses all CPU cores in parallel
* 100% pure Go with no dependencies besides the standard library

### TODO

Here are things that I'm hoping to add.

* bidirectional path tracing
* true BRDFs
* subsurface scattering
* atmosphere
* constructive solid geometry
